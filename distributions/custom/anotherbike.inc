@ Even with all four event tickets, it is impossible for the key items pocket to be full.
@ The pocket size is 30, but only 22 items can be present during normal gameplay.
@ Event tickets only raise this to 26.

@ Also, key items cannot be deposited into the PC or given to Pok√©mon,
@ so no need to check for that either.
