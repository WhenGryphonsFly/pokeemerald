# WhenGryphonsFly/pokeemerald/pokedistribution__main

This is the root repository for `pokedistribution`, a custom Mystery Gift distribution ROM. Originally based on `pokefirered`, the project is being rebased now that `pokeemerald`'s Mystery Gift decompilation is more fleshed out.

To compile, run `make -j$(nproc) modern`.

Releases will be available in a separate repository, located at [coming soon](example.com). Issues should be reported there.
